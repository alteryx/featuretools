    that determines the amount of data in each window.

    Args:
        series (Series): The series over which rolling windows will be created. The series must have numeric values and a DatetimeIndex.
        window_length (int, string): Specifies the amount of data included in each window.
            If an integer is provided, it will correspond to a number of rows. For data with a uniform sampling frequency,
            for example of one day, the window_length will correspond to a period of time, in this case,
            7 days for a window_length of 7.

        gap (int, string, optional): Specifies a gap backwards from each instance before the

            If a string is provided, it must be one of pandas' offset alias strings ('1D', '1H', etc),
            and it will indicate a length of time between a target instance and the beginning of its window.
            Defaults to 0, which will include the target instance in the window.
        min_periods (int, optional): Minimum number of observations required for performing calculations
            over the window. Can only be as large as window_length when window_length is an integer.
            When window_length is an offset alias string, this limitation does not exist, but care should be taken

        ignore_window_nans (bool, optional): Whether or not NaNs in the rolling window should be included in the rolling calculation.
            NaNs by default get counted towards min_periods. When set to true,
            all partial values calculated by `agg_func` in the rolling window get replaced with NaN.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The array of rolling calculated values.

    Note:
        Certain operations, like `pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.count` that can be performed
        on the Rolling object returned here may treat NaNs as periods to include in window calculations.
        So a window [NaN, 1, 3]  when `min_periods=3` will proceed with count, saying there are three periods
        but only two values and would return count=2. The calculation `max` on the other hand,
        would not recognize NaN as a valid period, and would therefore return `max=NaN` as the window has
        less valid periods (two, in this case) than `min_periods` (three, in this case).
        Most rolling calculations act this way. The implication of that here is that in order to
        achieve the gap, we insert NaNs at the beginning of the series, which would cause `count` to calculate
        on windows that technically should not have the correct number of periods. Any primitive that uses this function
        should determine whether `ignore_window_nans` should be set to `true`.

    Note:
        Only offset aliases with fixed frequencies can be used when defining gap and window_length.
        This means that aliases such as `M` or `W` cannot be used, as they can indicate different
        numbers of days. ('M', because different months have different numbers of days;
        'W' because week will indicate a certain day of the week, like W-Wed, so that will
        indicate a different number of days depending on the anchoring date.)

    Note:
        When using an offset alias to define `gap`, an offset alias must also be used to define `window_length`.
        This limitation does not exist when using an offset alias to define `window_length`. In fact,
        if the data has a uniform sampling frequency, it is preferable to use a numeric `gap` as it is more
        efficient."""
