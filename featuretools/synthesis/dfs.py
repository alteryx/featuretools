    '''Calculates a feature matrix and features given a dictionary of entities
    and a list of relationships.


    Args:
        entities (dict[str -> tuple(pd.DataFrame, str, str, dict[str -> Variable])]): dictionary of
            entities. Entries take the format
            {entity id -> (dataframe, id column, (time_column), (variable_types))}.
            Note that time_column and variable_types are optional.

        relationships (list[(str, str, str, str)]): List of relationships
            between entities. List items are a tuple with the format
            (parent entity id, parent variable, child entity id, child variable).

        entityset (EntitySet): An already initialized entityset. Required if
            entities and relationships are not defined.

        target_entity (str): Entity id of entity on which to make predictions.

        cutoff_time (pd.DataFrame or Datetime): Specifies times at which to calculate
            the features for each instance. The resulting feature matrix will use data
            up to and including the cutoff_time. Can either be a DataFrame or a single
            value. If a DataFrame is passed the instance ids for which to calculate features
            must be in a column with the same name as the target entity index or a column
            named `instance_id`. The cutoff time values in the DataFrame must be in a column with
            the same name as the target entity time index or a column named `time`. If the
            DataFrame has more than two columns, any additional columns will be added to the
            resulting feature matrix. If a single value is passed, this value will be used for
            all instances.

        instance_ids (list): List of instances on which to calculate features. Only
            used if cutoff_time is a single datetime.

        agg_primitives (list[str or AggregationPrimitive], optional): List of Aggregation
            Feature types to apply.

                Default: ["sum", "std", "max", "skew", "min", "mean", "count", "percent_true", "num_unique", "mode"]

        trans_primitives (list[str or TransformPrimitive], optional):
            List of Transform Feature functions to apply.

                Default: ["day", "year", "month", "weekday", "haversine", "num_words", "num_characters"]

        allowed_paths (list[list[str]]): Allowed entity paths on which to make
            features.

        max_depth (int) : Maximum allowed depth of features.

        ignore_entities (list[str], optional): List of entities to
            blacklist when creating features.

        ignore_variables (dict[str -> list[str]], optional): List of specific
            variables within each entity to blacklist when creating features.

        primitive_options (list[dict[str or tuple[str] -> dict] or dict[str or tuple[str] -> dict, optional]):
            Specify options for a single primitive or a group of primitives.
            Lists of option dicts are used to specify options per input for primitives
            with multiple inputs. Each option ``dict`` can have the following keys:

            ``"include_entities"``
                List of entities to be included when creating features for
                the primitive(s). All other entities will be ignored
                (list[str]).
            ``"ignore_entities"``
                List of entities to be blacklisted when creating features
                for the primitive(s) (list[str]).

                List of specific variables within each entity to include when
                creating feautres for the primitive(s). All other variables
                in a given entity will be ignored (dict[str -> list[str]]).
            ``"ignore_variables"``
                List of specific variables within each entityt to blacklist
                when creating features for the primitive(s) (dict[str ->
                list[str]]).
            ``"include_groupby_entities"``
                List of Entities to be included when finding groupbys. All
                other entities will be ignored (list[str]).

                List of entities to blacklist when finding groupbys
                (list[str]).
            ``"include_groupby_variables"``
                List of specific variables within each entity to include as
                groupbys, if applicable. All other variables in each
                entity will be ignored (dict[str -> list[str]]).
            ``"ignore_groupby_variables"``
                List of specific variables within each entity to blacklist
                as groupbys (dict[str -> list[str]]).

        seed_features (list[:class:`.FeatureBase`]): List of manually defined
            features to use.

        drop_contains (list[str], optional): Drop features
            that contains these strings in name.

        drop_exact (list[str], optional): Drop features that
            exactly match these strings in name.

        where_primitives (list[str or PrimitiveBase], optional):
            List of Primitives names (or types) to apply with where clauses.

                Default:

                    ["count"]

        max_features (int, optional) : Cap the number of generated features to
                this number. If -1, no limit.

        features_only (bool, optional): If True, returns the list of
            features without calculating the feature matrix.

        cutoff_time_in_index (bool): If True, return a DataFrame with a MultiIndex
            where the second index is the cutoff time (first is instance id).
            DataFrame will be sorted by (time, instance_id).

        training_window (Timedelta or str, optional):
            Window defining how much time before the cutoff time data
            can be used when calculating features. If ``None`` , all data
            before cutoff time is used. Defaults to ``None``. Month and year
            units are not relative when Pandas Timedeltas are used. Relative
            units should be passed as a Featuretools Timedelta or a string.

        approximate (Timedelta): Bucket size to group instances with similar
            cutoff times by for features with costly calculations. For example,
            if bucket is 24 hours, all instances with cutoff times on the same
            day will use the same calculation for expensive features.

        save_progress (str, optional): Path to save intermediate computational results.

        n_jobs (int, optional): number of parallel processes to use when
            calculating feature matrix

        chunk_size (int or float or None or "cutoff time", optional): Number
            of rows of output feature matrix to calculate at time. If passed an
            integer greater than 0, will try to use that many rows per chunk.
            If passed a float value between 0 and 1 sets the chunk size to that
            percentage of all instances. If passed the string "cutoff time",
            rows are split per cutoff time.

        dask_kwargs (dict, optional): Dictionary of keyword arguments to be
            passed when creating the dask client and scheduler. Even if n_jobs
            is not set, using `dask_kwargs` will enable multiprocessing.
            Main parameters:

            cluster (str or dask.distributed.LocalCluster):
                cluster or address of cluster to send tasks to. If unspecified,
                a cluster will be created.
            diagnostics port (int):
                port number to use for web dashboard.  If left unspecified, web
                interface will not be enabled.

            Valid keyword arguments for LocalCluster will also be accepted.

        return_variable_types (list[Variable] or str, optional): Types of
                variables to return. If None, default to
                Numeric, Discrete, and Boolean. If given as
                the string 'all', use all available variable types.

        progress_callback (callable): function to be called with incremental progress updates.
            Has the following parameters:

                update: percentage change (float between 0 and 100) in progress since last call
                progress_percent: percentage (float between 0 and 100) of total computation completed
                time_elapsed: total time in seconds that has elapsed since start of call

        include_cutoff_time (bool): Include data at cutoff times in feature calculations. Defaults to ``True``.
