    "## Discrete\n",
    "\n",
    "A Discrete variable type can only take certain values. It is a type of data that can be counted, but cannot be measured. If it can be classified into distinct buckets, then it a discrete variable type. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 sub-variable types of Discrete. These are Categorical, and Ordinal. If the data has a certain ordering, it is of Ordinal type. If it cannot be ordered, then is a Categorical type. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical \n",
    "\n",
    "A Categorical variable type can take unordered discrete values. It is usually a limited, and fixed number of possible values. Categorical variable types can be represented as strings, or integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of Categorical variable types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender\n",
    "- Eye Color\n",
    "- Nationality\n",
    "- Hair Color\n",
    "- Spoken Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ordinal variable type can take ordered discrete values. Similar to Categorical, it is usually a limited, and fixed number of possible values. However, these discrete values have a certain order, and the ordering is important to understanding the values. Ordinal variable types can be represented as strings, or integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of Ordinal variable types:\n",

    "- Educational Background (Elementary, High School, Undergraduate, Graduate)\n",

    "#### Categorical SubTypes (CountryCode, Id, SubRegionCode, ZIPCode)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also more distinctions within the Categorical variable type. These include CountryCode, Id, SubRegionCode, and ZIPCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to make this distinction because there are certain operations that can be applied, but they don't necessary apply to all Categorical types. For example, there could be a [custom primitive](https://docs.featuretools.com/en/stable/automated_feature_engineering/primitives.html#defining-custom-primitives) that applies to the ZIPCode variable type. It could extract the first 5 digits of a ZIPCode. However, this operation is not valid for all Categorical variable types. Therefore it is approriate to use the ZIPCode variable type. "

    "- flight departure time\n",
    "- pickup time\n",
    "\n",
    "### DateOfBirth\n",
    "A more distinct type of datetime is a DateOfBirth. This is an important distinction because it allows additional primitives to be applied to the data to generate new features. For example, having an DateOfBirth variable type, will allow the Age primitive to be applied during DFS, and lead to a new Numeric feature."
