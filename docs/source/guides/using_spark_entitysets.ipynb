    "Creating a feature matrix from a very large dataset can be problematic if the underlying pandas dataframes that make up the EntitySet cannot easily fit in memory. To help get around this issue, Featuretools supports creating ``EntitySet`` objects from Spark dataframes. A Spark ``EntitySet`` can then be passed to ``featuretools.dfs`` or ``featuretools.calculate_feature_matrix`` to create a feature matrix, which will be returned as a Spark dataframe. In addition to working on larger than memory datasets, this approach also allows users to take advantage of the parallel and distributed processing capabilities offered by Spark and Spark.\n",

    "This guide will provide an overview of how to create a Spark ``EntitySet`` and then generate a feature matrix from it. If you are already familiar with creating a feature matrix starting from pandas dataframes, this process will seem quite familiar, as there are no differences in the process. There are, however, some limitations when using Spark dataframes, and those limitations are reviewed in more detail below.\n",

Java is also required for PySpark and may need to be installed, see [the Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) for more details. We will create a very small Spark dataframe for this example. Spark dataframes can also be created from pandas dataframes, Spark dataframes, or read in directly from a file."

    "Featuretools stores the DataFrames that make up an EntitySet as Woodwork DataFrames, which include additional typing information about the columns that are in the DataFrame. When adding a DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, Woodwork will attempt to infer the logical types for any columns that do not have a logical type defined. This inference process can be quite expensive for Spark DataFrames. In order to skip type inference and speed up the process of adding a Spark DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, users can specify the logical type to use for each column in the DataFrame. A list of available logical types can be obtained by running ``featuretools.list_logical_types()``. To learn more about the limitations of a Spark dataframe with Woodwork typing, see the [Woodwork guide on Spark dataframes](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/using_woodwork_with_dask_and_spark.html#Spark-DataFrame-Example).\n",

Because performing this same check with Spark could be computationally expensive, this check is not performed when adding a Spark dataframe to an `EntitySet`. When using Spark dataframes, users must ensure that the supplied index values are unique.\n",

For a Spark DataFrame, the ordering of the DataFrame rows is not guaranteed, and Featuretools does not attempt to maintain row order in a Spark DataFrame.

This conversion will result in a warning, and the process could take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the size of the supplied dataframe.\n",
