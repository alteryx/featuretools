# SQL Database Integration

`featuretools_sql` is an add-on library that supports automatic `EntitySet` creation from a relational database.

Currently, `featuretools_sql` is compatible with the following systems:

* `MySQL`
* `PostgreSQL`

The `DBConnector` object exposed by the `featuretools_sql` library provides the interface to connecting to the DBMS.
