    "\n",
    "In multi-table datasets, a feature engineering window for a single row in the target DataFrame extends forward in time over observations in child DataFrames starting at the time index and ending when either the cutoff time or last time index is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Multi Table Timeline](../_static/images/multi_table_FE_timeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In single-table time series datasets, the feature engineering window for a single value extends backwards in time within the same column. Because of this, the concepts of cutoff time and last time index are not relevant in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: The cutoff time for a single-table time series dataset would create the training and test data split. During DFS, features would not be calculated after the cutoff time. This same behavior can often times be achieved more simply by splitting the data prior to creating the EntitySet, since filtering the data at feature matrix calculation is more computationally intensive than splitting the data ahead of time.\n",

    "So, since we can't use the existing parameters for defining each observation's feature engineering window, we'll need to define new the concepts of `gap` and `window_length`. These will allow us to set a feature engineering window that exists prior to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gap and Window Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will be using integers when defining the gap and window length. This implies that our data occurs at evenly spaced intervals--in this case daily--so a number `n` corresponds to `n` days. Support for unevenly spaced intervals is ongoing and can be explored with the Woodwork method [df.ww.infer_temporal_frequencies](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/generated/woodwork.table_accessor.WoodworkTableAccessor.infer_temporal_frequencies.html#woodwork.table_accessor.WoodworkTableAccessor.infer_temporal_frequencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are at a point in time `t`, we have access to information from times less than `t` (past values), and we do not have information from times greater than `t` (future values). Our limitations in feature engineering, then, will come from when exactly before `t` we have access to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we're recording data that takes a week to ingest; the earliest data we have access to is from seven days ago, or `t - 7`. We'll call this our `gap`. A `gap` of 0 would include the instance itself, which we must be careful to avoid in time series problems, as this exposes our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to determine how far back in time before `t - 7` we can go. Too far back, and we may lose the potency of our recent observations, but too recent, and we may not capture the full spectrum of behaviors displayed by the data. In this example, let's say that we only want to look at 5 days worth of data at a time. We'll call this our `window_length`. \n",

However, if we look at the data, we'll see that, though the day changes, the observations are always taken at the same hour, so the `Hour` primitive will not likely be useful. Of course, in a dataset that is measured at an hourly frequency or one more granular, `Hour` may be incrediby predictive. "
