    "Creating a feature matrix from a very large dataset can be problematic if the underlying pandas dataframes that make up the entities cannot easily fit in memory. To help get around this issue, Featuretools supports creating ``Entity`` and ``EntitySet`` objects from Koalas dataframes. A Koalas ``EntitySet`` can then be passed to ``featuretools.dfs`` or ``featuretools.calculate_feature_matrix`` to create a feature matrix, which will be returned as a Koalas dataframe. In addition to working on larger than memory datasets, this approach also allows users to take advantage of the parallel and distributed processing capabilities offered by Koalas and Spark.\n",

If you are already familiar with creating a feature matrix starting from pandas dataframes, this process will seem quite familiar, as there are no differences in the process. There are, however, some limitations when using Koalas dataframes, and those limitations are reviewed in more detail below.\n",

Java is also required for PySpark and may need to be installed, see `the Spark documentation <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_ for more details. We will create a very small Koalas dataframe for this example. Koalas dataframes can also be created from pandas dataframes, Spark dataframes, or read in directly from a file."

    "Primitive Limitations\n",
    "*********************\n",
    "At this time, custom primitives created with ``featuretools.primitives.make_trans_primitive()`` or ``featuretools.primitives.make_agg_primitive()`` cannot be used for running deep feature synthesis on a Koalas ``EntitySet``. While it is possible to create custom primitives for use with a Koalas ``EntitySet`` by extending the proper primitive class, there are several potential problems in doing so, and those issues are beyond the scope of this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Limitations\n",
    "******************\n",
    "When creating a Featuretools ``Entity`` from Koalas dataframes, logical type inference is not performed as it is when creating entities from pandas dataframes. This is done to improve speed as sampling the data to infer the logical types could require expensive computation on the underlying Koalas dataframe. As a consequence, users must define the logical types for each column in the supplied Dataframe. This step is needed so that the deep feature synthesis process can build the proper features based on the column types. A list of available logical types can be obtained by running ``featuretools.list_logical_types()``.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Featuretools checks that entities created from pandas dataframes have unique index values. Because performing this same check with Koalas could be computationally expensive, this check is not performed when creating an entity from a Koalas dataframe. When using Koalas dataframes, users must ensure that the supplied index values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ``Entity`` is created from a pandas dataframe, the ordering of the underlying dataframe rows is maintained. For a Koalas ``Entity``, the ordering of the dataframe rows is not guaranteed, and Featuretools does not attempt to maintain row order in a Koalas ``Entity``. If ordering is important, close attention must be paid to any output to avoid issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "EntitySet Limitations\n",
    "*********************\n",
    "When creating a Featuretools ``EntitySet`` that will be made of Koalas entities, all of the entities used to create the ``EntitySet`` must be of the same type, either all Koalas entities, all Dask entities, or all pandas entities. Featuretools does not support creating an ``EntitySet`` containing a mix of Koalas, Dask, and pandas entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the ``EntitySet.add_interesting_values()`` method is not supported when using a Koalas ``EntitySet``. If needed, users can manually set ``interesting_values`` on entities by assigning them directly with syntax similar to this: ``es[\"entity_name\"][\"variable_name\"].interesting_values = [\"Value 1\", \"Value 2\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS Limitations\n",
    "***************\n",
    "There are a few key limitations when generating a feature matrix from a Koalas ``EntitySet``.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a ``cutoff_time`` parameter is passed to ``featuretools.dfs()`` it should be a single cutoff time value, or a pandas dataframe. The current implementation will still work if a Koalas dataframe is supplied for cutoff times, but a ``.to_pandas()`` call will be made on the dataframe to convert it into a pandas dataframe. This conversion will result in a warning, and the process could take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the size of the supplied dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Featuretools does not currently support the use of the ``approximate`` or ``training_window`` parameters when working with Koalas entitiysets, but should in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if the output feature matrix contains a boolean column with ``NaN`` values included, the column type may have a different datatype than the same feature matrix generated from a pandas ``EntitySet``.  If feature matrix column data types are critical, the feature matrix should be inspected to make sure the types are of the proper types, and recast as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Limitations\n",
    "*****************\n",
    "Currently ``featuretools.encode_features()`` does not work with a Koalas dataframe as input. This will hopefully be resolved in a future release of Featuretools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function ``featuretools.make_temporal_cutoffs()`` will not work properly with Koalas inputs for ``instance_ids`` or ``cutoffs``. However, as noted above, if a ``cutoff_time`` dataframe is supplied to ``dfs``, the supplied dataframe should be a pandas dataframe, and this can be generated by supplying pandas inputs to ``make_temporal_cutoffs()``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of ``featuretools.remove_low_information_features()`` cannot currently be used with a Koalas feature matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "When manually defining a ``Feature``, the ``use_previous`` parameter cannot be used if this feature will be applied to calculate a feature matrix from a Koalas ``EntitySet``."
