    "Creating a feature matrix from a very large dataset can be problematic if the underlying pandas dataframes that make up the EntitySet cannot easily fit in memory. To help get around this issue, Featuretools supports creating ``EntitySet`` objects from Koalas dataframes. A Koalas ``EntitySet`` can then be passed to ``featuretools.dfs`` or ``featuretools.calculate_feature_matrix`` to create a feature matrix, which will be returned as a Koalas dataframe. In addition to working on larger than memory datasets, this approach also allows users to take advantage of the parallel and distributed processing capabilities offered by Koalas and Spark.\n",

If you are already familiar with creating a feature matrix starting from pandas dataframes, this process will seem quite familiar, as there are no differences in the process. There are, however, some limitations when using Koalas dataframes, and those limitations are reviewed in more detail below.\n",

We will create a very small Koalas dataframe for this example. Koalas dataframes can also be created from pandas dataframes, Spark dataframes, or read in directly from a file."

While it is possible to create custom primitives for use with a Koalas ``EntitySet`` by extending the proper primitive class, there are several potential problems in doing so, and those issues are beyond the scope of this guide.\n",

    "Featuretools stores the DataFrames that make up an EntitySet as Woodwork DataFrames, which include additional typing information about the columns that are in the DataFrame. When adding a DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, Woodwork will attempt to infer the logical types for any columns that do not have a logical type defined. This inference process can be quite expensive for Koalas DataFrames. In order to skip type inference and speed up the process of adding a Koalas DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, users can specify the logical type to use for each column in the DataFrame. A list of available logical types can be obtained by running ``featuretools.list_logical_types()``. To learn more about the limitations of a Koalas dataframe with Woodwork typing, see the [Woodwork guide on Koalas dataframes](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/using_woodwork_with_dask_and_koalas.html#Koalas-DataFrame-Example).\n",

    "By default, Woodwork checks that pandas dataframes have unique index values. Because performing this same check with Koalas could be computationally expensive, this check is not performed when adding a Koalas dataframe to an `EntitySet`. When using Koalas dataframes, users must ensure that the supplied index values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a pandas DataFrames, the ordering of the underlying DataFrame rows is maintained by Featuretools. For a Koalas DataFrame, the ordering of the DataFrame rows is not guaranteed, and Featuretools does not attempt to maintain row order in a Koalas DataFrame. If ordering is important, close attention must be paid to any output to avoid issues.\n",

The current implementation will still work if a Koalas dataframe is supplied for cutoff times, but a ``.to_pandas()`` call will be made on the dataframe to convert it into a pandas dataframe. This conversion will result in a warning, and the process could take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the size of the supplied dataframe.\n",
