While it is possible to create custom primitives for use with a Koalas ``EntitySet`` by extending the proper primitive class, there are several potential problems in doing so, and those issues are beyond the scope of this guide.\n",

    "### DataFrame Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools stores the DataFrames that make up an EntitySet as Woodwork DataFrames, which include additional typing information about the columns that are in the DataFrame. When adding a DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, Woodwork will attempt to infer the logical types for any columns that do not have a logical type defined. This inference process can be quite expensive for Koalas DataFrames. In order to skip type inference and speed up the process of adding a Koalas DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, users can specify the logical type to use for each column in the DataFrame. A list of available logical types can be obtained by running ``featuretools.list_logical_types()``. To learn more about the limitations of a Koalas dataframe with Woodwork typing, see the [Woodwork guide on Koalas dataframes](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/using_woodwork_with_dask_and_koalas.html#Koalas-DataFrame-Example).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Woodwork checks that pandas dataframes have unique index values. Because performing this same check with Koalas could be computationally expensive, this check is not performed when adding a Koalas dataframe to an `EntitySet`. When using Koalas dataframes, users must ensure that the supplied index values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a pandas DataFrames, the ordering of the underlying DataFrame rows is maintained by Featuretools. For a Koalas DataFrame, the ordering of the DataFrame rows is not guaranteed, and Featuretools does not attempt to maintain row order in a Koalas DataFrame. If ordering is important, close attention must be paid to any output to avoid issues.\n",

Featuretools does not support creating an ``EntitySet`` containing a mix of Koalas, Dask, and pandas dataframes.\n",

The current implementation will still work if a Koalas dataframe is supplied for cutoff times, but a ``.to_pandas()`` call will be made on the dataframe to convert it into a pandas dataframe. This conversion will result in a warning, and the process could take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the size of the supplied dataframe.\n",
