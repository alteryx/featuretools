    "# Woodwork Typing in Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools relies on having consistent typing across the creation of EntitySets, Primitives, Features, and feature matrices. Previously, Featuretools used its own type system, Variables; now and moving forward, Featuretools will use an external package for its typing: Woodwork. Featuretools is also used by Alteryx's open source autoML tool, EvalML, allowing a smooth transition from feature generation to model-building with a common type system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Woodwork](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/index.html) is a library that helps with the data typing of 2-dimensional tabular data structures by creating a namespace on your DataFrame that contains physical, logical, and semantic data types that can be used within the Alteryx Open Source ecosystem as well as in general machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth explanation of what is available as a part of Woodwork's type system can be found below, but to start,  here are several quick definitions of the types that are central to Woodwork:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "- Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "- Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full-length explanation of Woodwork's Types and Tags can be found [here](link). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Types \n",
    "Physcial types define how the data is stored on disk or in memory. You might also see the physical type for a column referred to as the column’s `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, Dask, and Koalas DataFrames rely on these dtypes when performing DataFrame operations, so knowing a Woodwork table's physical types is important for any DataFrame operations that might be performed. Each `LogicalType` has a single physical type associated with it, though multiple logical types can have the same physical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple LogicalTypes may have the same physical types, because a logical type adds additional information about how data should be interpreted or parsed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, email addresses and phone numbers would typically both be stored in a data column with a physical type of `string`. However, when reading, validating, and using these two types of information, different rules apply. For email addresses, the presence of the `@` symbol is important. For phone numbers, you might want to confirm that only a certain number of digits are present or use the first three digits to determine an area-code, and special characters might be restricted to `+`, `-`, `(` or `)`. In this particular example Woodwork defines two different logical types to separate these parsing needs: `EmailAddress` and `PhoneNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork uses many different logical types, which can be seen with the `list_logical_types` function."

   "execution_count": null,

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Featuretools will perform inference to assign logical types to the data in EntitySets, but we can specify which logical types should be set for any column (provided that the data in that column is compatible with the logical type). \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about how logical types are used in EntitySets, see the [Creating EntitySets guide](link). To learn more about setting logical types directly on a DataFrame, see the Woodwork guide on [working with Logical Types](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html#Working-with-Logical-Types). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantic Tags\n",
    "The `standard_tags` column in the `list_logical_types` output above contains semantic tags that Woodwork applies to specific logical types. These tags provide even more context about the meaning and potential uses of a column. For example, `Age` and `Integer` have the `int64` physical type, and `Double` has the `float64` physical type, but all three have the `numeric` tag, which ties them together in a way that physical types and logical types are not able to do alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike physical types and logical types, semantic tags are much less restrictive. A column might contain many semantic tags or none at all. Regardless, when assigning semantic tags, users should take care to not assign tags that have conflicting meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how semantic tags can be useful, consider a dataset with 2 date columns: a signup date and a user birth date. Both of these columns have the same physical type (`datetime64[ns]`), and both have the same logical type (`Datetime`), but the way one might interpret or use these columns is not the same. Semantic tags can be used to differentiate these columns. For example, you might want to add the `date_of_birth` semantic tag to the user birth date column to indicate this column has special meaning and could be used to compute a user’s age. Computing an age from the signup date column would not make sense, so the semantic tag can be used to differentiate between what the dates in these columns mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Woodwork Standard Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork adds a standard set of semantic tags to columns with LogicalTypes that fall under certain predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard tags are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'numeric'` - The tag applied to numeric Logical Types.\n",
    "    * `Integer`\n",
    "    * `IntegerNullable`\n",
    "    * `Double`\n",
    "    * `Age`\n",
    "    * `AgeNullable`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `'category'` - The tag applied to Logical Types that represent categorical variables.\n",
    "    * `Categorical`\n",
    "    * `CountryCode`\n",
    "    * `Ordinal`\n",
    "    * `PostalCode`\n",
    "    * `SubRegionCode`\n",
    "    \n",
    "To learn more about working with Woodwork semantic tags directly on a dataframe, see the Woodwork guide on [working with semantic tags](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html#Standard-Tags).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 2 tags that Woodwork adds to index columns. If no index columns have been specified, these tags are not present:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'index'` - on the index column, when specified\n",
    "* `'time_index'` on the time index column, when specified\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of standard tags, excluding the `index` and `time_index` tags, which have special meaning, can be controlled by the user at EntitySet creation or through Woodwork methods directly on the dataframe. This is discussed in more detail in the Woodwork guide on [setting the index](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html#Setting-the-index).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different semantic tags defined within Woodwork. To get a list of the standard, index, and time index tags, you can use the `list_semantic_tags` function."
