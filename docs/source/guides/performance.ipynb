    "Dask or Spark can be used with Featuretools to perform parallel feature computation with virtually no changes to the workflow required. Featuretools supports creating an `EntitySet` directly from Dask or Spark dataframes instead of using pandas dataframes, enabling the parallel and distributed computation capabilities of Dask or Spark to be used. By creating an `EntitySet` directly from Dask or Spark dataframes, Featuretools can be used to generate a larger-than-memory feature matrix, something that may be difficult with other approaches. When computing a feature matrix from an `EntitySet` created from Dask or Spark dataframes, the resulting feature matrix will be returned as a Dask or Spark dataframe depending on which type was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods do have some limitations in terms of the primitives that are available and the optional parameters that can be used when calculating the feature matrix. For more information on generating a feature matrix with this approach, refer to the guides [Using Dask Entitysets (BETA)](using_dask_entitysets.ipynb) and [Using Spark Entitysets (BETA)](using_spark_entitysets.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Parallel Feature Computation\n",
    "If using a pandas `EntitySet`, Featuretools can optionally compute features on multiple cores. The simplest way to control the amount of parallelism is to specify the `n_jobs` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "fm = ft.calculate_feature_matrix(features=features,\n",
    "                                 entityset=entityset,\n",
    "                                 cutoff_time=cutoff_time,\n",
    "                                 n_jobs=2,\n",
    "                                 verbose=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above command will start 2 processes to compute chunks of the feature matrix in parallel. Each process receives its own copy of the entityset, so memory use will be proportional to the number of parallel processes. Because the entityset has to be copied to each process, there is overhead to perform this operation before calculation can begin. To avoid this overhead on successive calls to `calculate_feature_matrix`, read the section below on using a persistent cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjust chunk size\n",
    "By default, Featuretools calculates rows with the same cutoff time simultaneously. The *chunk_size* parameter limits the maximum number of rows that will be grouped and then calculated together. If calculation is done using parallel processing, the default chunk size is set to be `1 / n_jobs` to ensure the computation can be spread across available workers. Normally, this behavior works well, but if there are only a few unique cutoff times it can lead to higher peak memory usage (due to more intermediate calculations stored in memory) or limited parallelism (if the number of chunks is less than *n_jobs*).\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting `chunk_size`, we can limit the maximum number of rows in each group to specific number or a percentage of the overall data when calling `ft.dfs` or `ft.calculate_feature_matrix`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "# use maximum  100 rows per chunk\n",
    "feature_matrix, features_list = ft.dfs(entityset=es,\n",
    "                                       target_dataframe_name=\"customers\",\n",
    "                                       chunk_size=100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also set chunk size to be a percentage of total rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "# use maximum 5% of all rows per chunk\n",
    "feature_matrix, features_list = ft.dfs(entityset=es,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using persistent cluster\n",
    "Behind the scenes, Featuretools uses [Dask's](http://dask.pydata.org/) distributed scheduler to implement multiprocessing. When you only specify the `n_jobs` parameter, a cluster will be created for that specific feature matrix calculation and destroyed once calculations have finished. A drawback of this is that each time a feature matrix is calculated, the entityset has to be transmitted to the workers again. To avoid this, we would like to reuse the same cluster between calls. The way to do this is by creating a cluster first and telling featuretools to use it with the `dask_kwargs` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "import featuretools as ft\n",
    "from dask.distributed import LocalCluster\n",

    "                                   cutoff_time=cutoff_time,\n",
    "                                   dask_kwargs={'cluster': cluster},\n",
    "                                   verbose=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'cluster' value can either be the actual cluster object or a string of the address the cluster's scheduler can be reached at. The call below would also work. This second feature matrix calculation will not need to resend the entityset data to the workers because it has already been saved on the cluster.\n",

This means if two ``EntitySets`` have the same metadata but different row values (e.g. new data is added to the ``EntitySet``), Featuretools wonâ€™t recopy the second ``EntitySet`` in later calls. A simple way to avoid this scenario is to use a unique ``EntitySet`` id."

In this case, we can load in data partitioned by zip code. As long as we have all of the data for a zip code when calculating, we can calculate all features for a subset of customers.\n",
