    "Creating a feature matrix from a very large dataset can be problematic if the underlying pandas dataframes that make up the EntitySet cannot easily fit in memory. To help get around this issue, Featuretools supports creating `EntitySet` objects from Dask dataframes. A Dask `EntitySet` can then be passed to `featuretools.dfs` or `featuretools.calculate_feature_matrix` to create a feature matrix, which will be returned as a Dask dataframe. In addition to working on larger than memory datasets, this approach also allows users to take advantage of the parallel and distributed processing capabilities offered by Dask.\n",

    "### DataFrame Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools stores the DataFrames that make up an EntitySet as Woodwork DataFrames which include additional typing information about the columns that are in the DataFrame. When adding a DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, Woodwork will attempt to infer the logical types for any columns that do not have a logical type defined. This inference process can be quite expensive for Dask DataFrames. In order to skip type inference and speed up the process of adding a Dask DataFrame to an `EntitySet`, users can specify the logical type to use for each column in the DataFrame. A list of available logical types can be obtained by running ``featuretools.list_logical_types()``. To learn more about the limitations of a Dask dataframe with Woodwork typing, see the [Woodwork guide on Dask dataframes](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/using_woodwork_with_dask_and_spark.html#Dask-DataFrame-Example).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Woodwork checks that pandas DataFrames have unique index values. Because performing this same check with Dask would require an expensive compute operation, this check is not performed when adding a Dask DataFrame to an `EntitySet`. When using Dask DataFrames, users must ensure that the supplied index values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a pandas DataFrames, the ordering of the underlying DataFrame rows is maintained by Featuretools. For a Dask DataFrame, the ordering of the DataFrame rows is not guaranteed, and Featuretools does not attempt to maintain row order. If ordering is important, close attention must be paid to any output to avoid issues.\n",

Featuretools does not support creating an `EntitySet` containing a mix of Dask and pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",

    "If a `cutoff_time` parameter is passed to `featuretools.dfs()` it should be a single cutoff time value, or a pandas DataFrame. The current implementation will still work if a Dask DataFrame is supplied for cutoff times, but a `.compute()` call will be made on the DataFrame to convert it into a pandas DataFrame. This conversion will result in a warning, and the process could take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the size of the supplied DataFrame.\n",

    "Additionally, Featuretools does not currently support the use of the `approximate` or `training_window` parameters when working with Dask EntitySets, but should in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if the output feature matrix contains a boolean column with `NaN` values included, the column type may have a different datatype than the same feature matrix generated from a pandas `EntitySet`.  If feature matrix column data types are critical, the feature matrix should be inspected to make sure the types are of the expected types, and recast as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances, generating a feature matrix with a large number of features has resulted in memory issues on Dask workers. The underlying reason for this is that the partition size of the feature matrix grows too large for Dask to handle as the number of feature columns grows large. This issue is most prevalent when the feature matrix contains a large number of columns compared to the DataFrames in the EntitySet. Possible solutions to this problem include reducing the partition size used when creating the DataFrames or increasing the memory available on Dask workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently `featuretools.encode_features()` does not work with a Dask DataFrame as input. This will hopefully be resolved in a future release of Featuretools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function `featuretools.make_temporal_cutoffs()` will not work properly with Dask inputs for `instance_ids` or `cutoffs`. However, as noted above, if a `cutoff_time` DataFrame is supplied to `dfs`, the supplied DataFrame should be a pandas DataFrame, and this can be generated by supplying pandas inputs to `make_temporal_cutoffs()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `featuretools.remove_low_information_features()` cannot currently be used with a Dask feature matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "When manually defining a `Feature`, the `use_previous` parameter cannot be used if this feature will be applied to calculate a feature matrix from a Dask `EntitySet`."
