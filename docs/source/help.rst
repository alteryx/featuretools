Asking for help
---------------
All users levels, including beginners, should feel free to ask questions and
report bugs when using featuretools. You can get better answers if follow a
few simple guidelines:

1.  **Use the right resource**: We suggest using Github or StackOverflow.
    Questions asked at these locations will be more searchable for other users.

    - Gitter should only be used for developer and community discussion.
    - General questions on how something should work or tips, use StackOverflow.
    - Bugs should be reported on Github.

2.  **Ask in one place only**: Please post your question in one place
    (StackOverflow or Github).

3.  **Use examples**: Make `minimal, complete, verifiable examples
    <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_. You will get
    much better answers if your provide code that people can use to reproduce
    your problem.

4.  **Sharing data privately**: If you have data that you can't share publicly,
    feel free to send an email to help@featuretools.com.
