    "# Transitioning to Featuretools Version 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools version 1.0 incorporates many significant changes that impact the way EntitySets are created, how primitives are defined, and in some cases the resulting feature matrix that is created. This document will provide an overview of the significant changes, helping existing Featuretools users transition to version 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why make these changes?\n",
    "The lack of a unified type system across libraries makes sharing information between libraries more difficult. This problem led to the development of [Woodwork](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/). Updating Featuretools to use Woodwork for managing column typing information enables easy sharing of feature matrix column types with other libraries without costly conversions between custom type systems. As an example, [EvalML](https://evalml.alteryx.com/en/stable/), which has also adopted Woodwork, can now use Woodwork typing information on a feature matrix directly to create machine learning models, without first inferring or redefining column types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other benefits of using Woodwork for managing typing in Featuretools include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplified code - custom type management code has been removed\n",
    "- Seamless integration of new types and improvements to type integration as Woodwork improves\n",
    "- Easy and flexible storage of additional information about columns. For example, we can now store whether a feature was engineered by Featuretools or present in the original data."

    "- Both the `Entity` and `Variable` classes have been removed from Featuretools\n",

This change also impacts the way relationships, features and primitives are defined, requiring different parameters than were previously required. Also, because the Woodwork typing system is not identical to the old Featuretools typing system, in some cases the feature matrix that is returned can be slightly different as a result of columns being identified as different types.\n",

    "\n",
    "In previous versions of Featuretools an EntitySet was created by adding multiple entities and then defining relationships between variables (columns) in different entities. Starting in Featuretools version 1.0, EntitySets are now created by adding multiple dataframes and defining relationships between columns in the dataframes.

    "In addition to the changes in argument names, there are a couple other changes to the returned feature matrix that users should be aware of. First, because of slight differences in the way Woodwork defines column types compared to how the prior Featuretools implementation did, there can be some differences in the features that are generated between old and new versions. The most notable impact is in the way foreign key columns are handled. Previously, Featuretools treated all foreign key (previously `Id`) columns as categorical columns, and would generate appropriate features from these columns. Starting in version 1.0, foreign key columns are not constrained to be categorical, and if they are another type such as `Integer`, features will not be generated from these columns. Manually converting foreign key columns to `Categorical` as shown above will result in features much closer to those achieved with previous versions.\n",

    "Also, because Woodwork's type inference process differs from the previous Featuretools type inference process, an EntitySet may have column types identified differently. This difference in column types could impact the features that are generated. If it is important to have the same set of features, check all of the logical types in the EntitySet dataframes and update them to the expected types if there are columns that have been inferred as unexpected types.\n",
