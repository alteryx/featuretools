    "- For example, a customer’s session has multiple transactions which can happen at different points in time. If we are trying to count the number of sessions a user has in a given time period, we often want to count all the sessions that had any transaction during the training window. To accomplish this, we need to not only know when a session starts (**time_index**), but also when it ends (**last_time_index**). The last time that an instance appears in the data is stored as the last_time_index of an Entity. \n",
    "- Once the last_time_index has been set, Featuretools will check to see if the last_time_index is after the start of the training window. That, combined with the cutoff time, allows DFS to discover which data is relevant for a given training window."
