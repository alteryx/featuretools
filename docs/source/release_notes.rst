**v0.20.0 Sep 30, 2020**
    .. warning::

        * Fix duplicate label column generation when labels are passed in cutoff times and approximate is being used (:pr:`1160`)
        * Determine calculate_feature_matrix behavior with approximate and a cutoff df that is a subclass of a pandas DataFrame (:pr:`1166`)
    * Changes
        * Text variable type has been replaced with NaturalLanguage (:pr:`1159`)
    * Documentation Changes
        * Update release doc for clarity and to add Future Release template (:pr:`1151`)
        * Use the PyData Sphinx theme (:pr:`1169`)
    * Testing Changes

**v0.19.0 Sept 8, 2020**
    * Enhancements
        * Support use of Koalas DataFrames in entitysets (:pr:`1031`)
        * Add feature selection functions for null, correlated, and single value features (:pr:`1126`)
    * Fixes
        * Fix ``encode_features`` converting excluded feature columns to a numeric dtype (:pr:`1123`)
        * Improve performance of unused primitive check in dfs (:pr:`1140`)
    * Changes
        * Remove the ability to stack transform primitives (:pr:`1119`, :pr:`1145`)
        * Sort primitives passed to ``dfs`` to get consistent ordering of features\* (:pr:`1119`)
    * Documentation Changes
        * Added return values to dfs and calculate_feature_matrix (:pr:`1125`)
    * Testing Changes
        * Better test case for normalizing from no time index to time index (:pr:`1113`)

    \* When passing multiple instances of a primitive built with ``make_trans_primitive``
    or ``maxe_agg_primitive``, those instances must have the same relative order when passed
    to ``dfs`` to ensure a consistent ordering of features.

**Breaking Changes**

* ``ft.dfs`` will no longer build features from Transform primitives where one
  of the inputs is a Transform feature, a GroupByTransform feature,
  or a Direct Feature of a Transform / GroupByTransform feature. This will make some
  features that would previously be generated by ``ft.dfs`` only possible if
  explicitly specified in ``seed_features``.

    * Fixes
        * Fix ``EntitySet.plot()`` when given a dask entityset (:pr:`1086`)

**Breaking Changes**

* Calls to ``featuretools.dfs`` or ``featuretools.calculate_feature_matrix`` that use a cutoff time
  dataframe, but do not label the time column with either the target entity time index variable name or
  as ``time``, will now result in an ``AttributeError``. Previously, the time column was selected to be the first
  column that was not the instance id column. With this update, the position of the column in the dataframe is
  no longer used to determine the time column. Now, both instance id columns and time columns in a cutoff time
  dataframe can be in any order as long as they are named properly.

* The ``type_string`` attributes of all ``Variable`` subclasses are now a snake case conversion of their class names. This
  changes the ``type_string`` of the ``Unknown``, ``IPAddress``, ``EmailAddress``, ``SubRegionCode``, ``FilePath``, ``LatLong``, and ``ZIPcode`` classes.
  Old saved entitysets that used these variables may load incorrectly.

    * Changes
        * Change premium primitives CI test to Python 3.6 (:pr:`916`)
        * Remove Python 3.5 support (:pr:`917`)
    * Documentation Changes
        * Fix README links to docs (:pr:`872`)
        * Fix Github links with correct organizations (:pr:`908`)
        * Fix hyperlinks in docs and docstrings with updated address (:pr:`910`)
        * Remove unused script for uploading docs to AWS (:pr:`911`)

    :user:`frances-h`, :user:`gsheni`, :user:`jeff-hernandez`, :user:`rwedge`

**Breaking Changes**

* Using training windows in feature calculations can result in different values than previous versions.
  This was done to prevent consecutive training windows from overlapping by excluding data at the oldest point in time.
  For example, if we use a cutoff time at the first minute of the hour with a one hour training window,
  the first minute of the previous hour will no longer be included in the feature calculation.

**Breaking Changes**

* ``ft.dfs`` now has a ``groupby_trans_primitives`` parameter that DFS uses to automatically construct features that group by an ID column and then apply a transform primitive to search group. This change applies to the following primitives: ``CumSum``, ``CumCount``, ``CumMean``, ``CumMin``, and ``CumMax``.

    Previous behavior

    .. code-block:: python

        ft.dfs(entityset=es,
               target_entity='customers',
               trans_primitives=["cum_mean"])

    New behavior

    .. code-block:: python

        ft.dfs(entityset=es,
               target_entity='customers',
               groupby_trans_primitives=["cum_mean"])

* Related to the above change, cumulative transform features are now defined using a new feature class, ``GroupByTransformFeature``.

    Previous behavior

    .. code-block:: python

        ft.Feature([base_feature, groupby_feature], primitive=CumulativePrimitive)


    New behavior

    .. code-block:: python

        ft.Feature(base_feature, groupby=groupby_feature, primitive=CumulativePrimitive)
