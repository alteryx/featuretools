Featuretools Enterprise
***********************

`Featuretools Enterprise <https://www.featurelabs.com/featuretools/>`__ offers additional primitives, functionality, performance and expert support.

Premium Primitives
------------------
Feature primitives are the building blocks of Featuretools. They define individual computations that can be applied to raw datasets to create new features. Featuretools Enterprise contains over 100 domain-specific premium primitives to help you build better features for more accurate models. A list of all premium primitives can be obtained by visiting `primitives.featurelabs.com <https://primitives.featurelabs.com/>`__.


Running Featuretools with Spark and Dask
----------------------------------------
Looking to easily scale Featuretools to bigger datasets or integrate it into your existing big data infrastructure? Whether it’s on-premise or in the cloud, you can run Featuretools Enterprise with Apache Spark and Dask. We have yet to encounter a dataset that is too large to handle.

The Featuretools development team is continually working to improve integration with Dask and Spark for performing feature engineering at scale. If you have a big data problem and are interested in testing our latest Dask or Spark integrations for free, please let us know by completing `this simple request form <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2TkvUj0wj0id66bXfx6v2ASd4JAap6pFigRj7EKGsuBUNDI4WDlGSzI1VVRHTUdMS0gyR1EyMkdJVi4u>`__.
