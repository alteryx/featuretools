Steadily, more and more people are building pipelines that use featuretools. This is encouraging because it provides validation for the importance of feature engineering.
In addition, many Kaggle competitors are using featuretools, which shows us the gained valued in adding featuretools to your data science pipeline.

Libraries
---------
`featuretools for Spark`_
=========================
- This is a python library written to scale FeatureTools with Spark. While we have developed an `internal tutorial`_, this is external resource you can use.

Use Cases
---------
`Will a user become a top-tier customer?`_
==========================================
- A common use case for machine learning is to create a model for predicting customer lifetime value. This article describes the business value of this prediction, explains the machine learning methodology, and show how well the results performed.
