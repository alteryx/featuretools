Asking for help
---------------

We welcome usage questions and bug reports from all users, even those who are
new to using featuretools.  There are a few things you can do to improve the
likelihood of quickly getting a good answer.

1.  **Ask questions in the right place**:  We strongly prefer the use
    of StackOverflow or Github issues over Gitter chat.  Github and
    StackOverflow are more easily searchable by future users, and therefore is more
    efficient for everyone's time.  Gitter chat is strictly reserved for
    developer and community discussion.

    If you have a general question about how something should work or
    want best practices then use Stack Overflow.  If you think you have found a
    bug then use GitHub.

2.  **Ask only in one place**: Please restrict yourself to posting your
    question in only one place (likely Stack Overflow or Github) and don't post
    in both.
