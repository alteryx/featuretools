    "# Woodwork Typing in Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools relies on having consistent typing across the creation of EntitySets, Primitives, Features, and feature matrices. Previously, Featuretools used its own type system that contained objects called Variables. Now and moving forward, Featuretools will use an external package for its typing: [Woodwork](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork is a library that helps with the data typing of 2-dimensional tabular data structures. Initializing Woodwork on a DataFrame creates a namespace, `ww`, that contains physical, logical, and semantic data types that can be used within the Alteryx Open Source ecosystem as well as in general machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these Woodwork types and how they work together to create Woodwork's type system will allow users to build EntitySets that best represent their data, understand the possible input and return types for Featuretools' Primitives, and understand what features will get generated from a given set of data and primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "- Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "- Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [Understanding Woodwork Logical Types and Semantic Tags](link) guide for an in-depth walkthrough of the available Woodwork types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [Working with Woodwork Types and Tags](link) guide to learn more about manipulating these types on a Woodwork DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users that are familiar with the old `Variable` ojbects, the [Transitioning from Variables to Woodwork](link) guide will be useful for converting Variable types to Woodwork types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Types \n",
    "Physcial types define how the data in a Woodwork DataFrame is stored on disk or in memory. You might also see the physical type for a column referred to as the column’s `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, Dask, and Koalas DataFrames rely on these dtypes when performing DataFrame operations, so knowing a Woodwork table's physical types is important for any DataFrame operations that might be performed. Each `LogicalType` class has a single physical type associated with it, though multiple logical types can have the same physical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple logical types may have the same physical types, because a logical type adds additional information about how data should be interpreted or parsed beyond what can be contained in a physical type. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, email addresses and phone numbers would typically both be stored in a data column with a physical type of `string`. However, when reading, validating, and using these two types of information, different rules apply. For email addresses, the presence of the `@` symbol is important. For phone numbers, you might want to confirm that only a certain number of digits are present or use the first three digits to determine an area-code, and special characters might be restricted to `+`, `-`, `(` or `)`. In this particular example Woodwork defines two different logical types to separate these parsing needs: `EmailAddress` and `PhoneNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides many different logical types, which can be seen with the `list_logical_types` function."

    "Featuretools will perform type inference to assign logical types to the data in EntitySets, but it is also possible to specify which logical types should be set for any column (provided that the data in that column is compatible with the logical type). \n",

To learn more about setting logical types directly on a DataFrame, see the Woodwork guide on [working with Logical Types](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html#Working-with-Logical-Types). \n",

    "## Semantic Tags\n",
    "The `standard_tags` column in the `list_logical_types` output above contains semantic tags that Woodwork applies to specific logical types. These tags provide even more context about the meaning and potential uses of a column. \n",
    "\n",
    "One use of semantic tags can be in grouping certain columns toghether. For example: `Age` and `Integer` have the `int64` physical type, and `Double` has the `float64` physical type, but all three have the `numeric` tag, which ties them together in a way that physical types and logical types are not able to do alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic tags can also be used to provide further specificity beyond logical types. Consider a dataset with 2 date columns: a signup date and a user birth date. Both of these columns have the same physical type (`datetime64[ns]`), and both have the same logical type (`Datetime`), but the way one might interpret or use these columns is not the same. This time, semantic tags can be used to differentiate these columns. For example, you might want to add the `date_of_birth` semantic tag to the user birth date column to indicate this column has special meaning and could be used to compute a user’s age. Computing an age from the signup date column would not make sense, so the semantic tag can be used to differentiate between what the dates in these columns mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Woodwork Standard Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork will add certain tags to columns at initialization. As we mentioned above, one type of these tags is standard tags that may be associated with different sets logical types that fall under certain predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard tags for each logical type can be seen in the `standard_tags` column of the `list_logical_types` output above. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are also 2 tags that Woodwork adds only to index columns. If no index columns have been specified, these tags are not present:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'index'` - on the index column, when specified\n",
    "* `'time_index'` on the time index column, when specified\n",
    "\n",
    "These `index` and `time_index` tags, which have special meaning, can be controlled by the user at EntitySet creation or through Woodwork methods directly on the DataFrame. This is discussed in more detail in the Woodwork guide on [setting the index](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html#Setting-the-index).\n",
