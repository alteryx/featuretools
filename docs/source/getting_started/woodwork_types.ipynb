    "# Woodwork Typing in Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools relies on having consistent typing across the creation of EntitySets, Primitives, Features, and feature matrices. Previously, Featuretools used its own type system that contained objects called Variables. Now and moving forward, Featuretools will use an external data typing library for its typing: [Woodwork](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Woodwork types that exist and how Featuretools uses Woodwork's type system will allow users to:\n",
    "    - build EntitySets that best represent their data\n",
    "    - understand the possible input and return types for Featuretools' Primitives\n",
    "    - understand what features will get generated from a given set of data and primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [Understanding Woodwork Logical Types and Semantic Tags](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/logical_types_and_semantic_tags.html) guide for an in-depth walkthrough of the available Woodwork types that are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users that are familiar with the old `Variable` objects, the [Transitioning to Featuretools Version 1.0](../resources/transition_to_ft_v1.0.ipynb) guide will be useful for converting Variable types to Woodwork types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Types \n",
    "Physical types define how the data in a Woodwork DataFrame is stored on disk or in memory. You might also see the physical type for a column referred to as the columnâ€™s `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing a Woodwork DataFrame's physical types is important because Pandas, Dask, and Spark rely on these types when performing DataFrame operations. Each Woodwork `LogicalType` class has a single physical type associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Types\n",
    "Logical types add additional information about how data should be interpreted or parsed beyond what can be contained in a physical type. In fact, multiple logical types have the same physical type, each imparting a different meaning that's not contained in the physical type alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Featuretools, a column's logical type informs how data is read into an EntitySet and how it gets used down the line in Deep Feature Synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides many different logical types, which can be seen with the `list_logical_types` function."

    "Featuretools will perform type inference to assign logical types to the data in EntitySets if none are provided, but it is also possible to specify which logical types should be set for any column (provided that the data in that column is compatible with the logical type).\n",

    "To learn more about how logical types are used in EntitySets, see the [Creating EntitySets](using_entitysets.ipynb) guide.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Semantic Tags\n",
    "Semantic tags provide additional information to columns about the meaning or potential uses of data. Columns can have many or no semantic tags. Some tags are added by Woodwork, some are added by Featuretools, and users can add additional tags as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about setting semantic tags directly on a DataFrame, see the Woodwork guide on [working with Semantic Tags](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/working_with_types_and_tags.html#Working-with-Semantic-Tags). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Woodwork-defined Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork will add certain semantic tags to columns at initialization. These can be standard tags that may be associated with different sets of logical types or index tags. There are also tags that users can add to confer a suggested meaning to columns in Woodwork.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The `date_of_birth` tag will not get automatically added by Woodwork, so in order for Featuretools to be able to use the `Age` primitive, the `date_of_birth` tag must be manually added to any columns to which it applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Featuretools-defined Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",

    "- `'last_time_index'` - added by Featuretools to the last time index column of a DataFrame. Indicates that this column has been created by Featuretools.\n",
