    "# Woodwork Typing in Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools relies on having consistent typing across the creation of EntitySets, Primitives, Features, and feature matrices. Previously, Featuretools used its own type system that contained objects called Variables. Now and moving forward, Featuretools will use an external package for its typing: [Woodwork](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork is a library that helps with the data typing of 2-dimensional tabular data structures. Initializing Woodwork on a DataFrame creates a namespace, `ww`, that contains physical, logical, and semantic data types that can be used within the Alteryx Open Source ecosystem as well as in general machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these Woodwork types and how they work together to create Woodwork's type system will allow users to build EntitySets that best represent their data, understand the possible input and return types for Featuretools' Primitives, and understand what features will get generated from a given set of data and primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "- Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "- Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [Understanding Woodwork Logical Types and Semantic Tags](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/logical_types_and_semantic_tags.html) guide for an in-depth walkthrough of the available Woodwork types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [Working with Woodwork Types and Tags](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/working_with_types_and_tags.html) guide to learn more about manipulating these types on a Woodwork DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users that are familiar with the old `Variable` ojbects, the [Transitioning from Variables to Woodwork](link) guide will be useful for converting Variable types to Woodwork types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Types \n",
    "Physcial types define how the data in a Woodwork DataFrame is stored on disk or in memory. You might also see the physical type for a column referred to as the columnâ€™s `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, Dask, and Koalas DataFrames rely on these dtypes when performing DataFrame operations, so knowing a Woodwork table's physical types is important for any DataFrame operations that might be performed. Each `LogicalType` class has a single physical type associated with it, though multiple logical types can have the same physical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple logical types may have the same physical types, because a logical type adds additional information about how data should be interpreted or parsed beyond what can be contained in a physical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A column's logical type informs how data is read into an EntitySet and how it gets used down the line in Deep Feature Synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides many different logical types, which can be seen with the `list_logical_types` function."
