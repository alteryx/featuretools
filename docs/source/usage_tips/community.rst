For demos written by Feature Labs, checkout our [demos](https://www.featuretools.com/demos/). 

Steadily, more and more people are building pipelines that use featuretools. This is encouraging because it provides validation for the importance of feature engineering.

### Libraries
##### [featuretools for Spark](https://github.com/pan5431333/featuretools4s)
- This is a python library written to scale FeatureTools with Spark. While we have developed an [internal tutorial](https://github.com/pan5431333/featuretools4s), this is external resource you can use.

### Use Cases
##### [Will a user become a top-tier customer?](https://towardsdatascience.com/automating-interpretable-feature-engineering-for-predicting-clv-87ece7da9b36)
- A common use case for machine learning is to create a model for predicting customer lifetime value. This article describes the business value of this prediction, explains the machine learning methodology, and show how well the results performed.
### Tutorials
##### [Automated Feature Engineering in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-in-python-99baf11cc219)
- This article provides a walkthrough of how to user our demo retail dataset and use DFS for automated feature engineering.

##### [Automated Feature Engineering for Predictive Modeling](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-for-predictive-modeling-d8c9fa4e478b)
- Many users of Kagglers are eager to use featuretools to improve their model performance. In this blog post, we see how a user takes a NHL dataset containing game information, and uses featuretools to create a sklearn model.

#####  [A Hands-On Guide to Automated Feature Engineering using Featuretools in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/guide-automated-feature-engineering-featuretools-python/)
- A **in-depth** tutorial that works through using featuretools and explains the importance of feature engineering.

##### [Simple Automatic Feature Engineering — Using featuretools in Python for Classification](https://medium.com/@rrfd/simple-automatic-feature-engineering-using-featuretools-in-python-for-classification-b1308040e183)
- A walkthrough which takes a user-generated dataset, and create a classifier to predict clients who make large orders. It also shows how to understand which features were the most important in classifing these clients.

##### [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering Using Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS)](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/introduction-to-automated-feature-engineering-using-deep-feature-synthesis-dfs-3feb69a7c00b)
- A comprehensive guide on feature engineering, and how to use featuretools. Using the loan dataset, we see how featuretools helps automate the manual process of feature engineering.

##### [Automated Feature Engineering Workshop](https://github.com/fred-navruzov/featuretools-workshop)
- From the 2017 Data Summer Conference, an automated feature engineering workshop using featuretools.

##### [Tutorial in Japanese](https://dev.classmethod.jp/machine-learning/yoshim-featuretools-boruta-optuna/)
- A tutorial of featuretools that works with a hyper parameter tuning library ([Optuna](https://github.com/pfnet/optuna)), and a feature selection library ([Boruta](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py)).
