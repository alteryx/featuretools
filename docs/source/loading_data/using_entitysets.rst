Representing Data with EntitySets
=================================
.. currentmodule:: featuretools

An ``EntitySet`` is a collection of entities and the relationships between them. They are useful for preparing raw, structured datasets for feature engineering. While many functions in Featuretools  take ``entities`` and ``relationships`` as separate arguments, it is recommended to create an ``EntitySet``, so you can more easily manipulate your data as needed.


The Raw Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below we have a two tables of data (represented as Pandas DataFrames) related to customer transactions. The first is a merge of transactions, sessions, and customers so that the result looks like something you might see in a log file:

.. ipython:: python

    import featuretools as ft
    data = ft.demo.load_mock_customer()
    transactions_df = data["transactions"].merge(data["sessions"]).merge(data["customers"])

    transactions_df.sample(10)

And the second dataframe is a list of products involved in those transactions.

.. ipython:: python

    products_df = data["products"]
    products_df


Creating an EntitySet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we initialize an EntitySet. If you'd like to give it name, you can optionally provide an ``id`` to the constructor.

.. ipython:: python

    es = ft.EntitySet(id="customer_data")


Adding entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, we load the transactions dataframe as an entity.

.. ipython:: python

    es = es.entity_from_dataframe(entity_id="transactions",
                                  dataframe=transactions_df,
                                  index="transaction_id",
                                  time_index="transaction_time",
                                  variable_types={"product_id": ft.variable_types.Categorical,
                                                  "zip_code": ft.variable_types.ZIPCode})
    es

.. note ::

    You can also display your entity set structure graphically by calling :meth:`.EntitySet.plot`.

This method loads each column in the dataframe in as a variable. We can see the variables in an entity using the code below.

.. ipython:: python

    es["transactions"].variables

In the call to ``entity_from_dataframe``, we specified three important parameters

* The ``index`` parameter specifies the column that uniquely identifies rows in the dataframe
* The ``time_index`` parameter tells Featuretools when the data was created.
* The ``variable_types`` parameter indicates that "product_id" should be interpreted as a Categorical variable, even though it just an integer in the underlying data.


Now, we can do that same thing with our products dataframe

.. ipython:: python

    es = es.entity_from_dataframe(entity_id="products",
                                  dataframe=products_df,
                                  index="product_id")

    es

With two entities in our entity set, we can add a relationship between them.

Adding a Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want to relate these two entities by the columns called "product_id" in each entity. Each product has multiple transactions associated with it, so it is called it the **parent entity**, while the transactions entity is known as the **child entity**. When specifying relationships we list the variable in the parent entity first. Note that each `ft.Relationship` must denote a one-to-many relationship rather than a relationship which is one-to-one or many-to-many.

.. ipython:: python

    new_relationship = ft.Relationship(es["products"]["product_id"],
                                       es["transactions"]["product_id"])
    es = es.add_relationship(new_relationship)
    es

Now, we see the relationship has been added to our entity set.


Creating entity from existing table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working with raw data, it is common to have sufficient information to justify the creation of new entities. In order to create a new entity and relationship for sessions, we "normalize" the transaction entity.

.. ipython:: python

    es = es.normalize_entity(base_entity_id="transactions",
                             new_entity_id="sessions",
                             index="session_id",
                             make_time_index="session_start",
                             additional_variables=["device", "customer_id", "zip_code", "session_start", "join_date"])

    es

Looking at the output above, we see this method did two operations

1. It created a new entity called "sessions" based on the "session_id" variable in "transactions"
2. It added a relationship connecting "transactions" and "sessions".

If we look at the variables in transactions and the new sessions entity, we see two more operations that were performed automatically.

.. ipython:: python

    es["transactions"].variables
    es["sessions"].variables

1. It removed "device", "customer_id", "zip_code", "session_start" and "join_date" from "transactions" and created a new variables in the sessions entity. This reduces redundant information as the those properties of a session don't change between transactions.
2. It marked "session_start" as a time index in the new sessions entity to indicate the beginning of a session. By default, unless it's explicitly set to another variable, ``normalize_entity`` would have made a "first_transactions_time" in this entity. If we don't want this variable to be created, we can set ``make_time_index=False``.

If we look at the dataframes, can see what the ``normalize_entity`` did to the actual data.

.. ipython:: python

    es["sessions"].df.head(5)
    es["transactions"].df.head(5)


To finish preparing this dataset, create a "customers" entity using the same method call.

.. ipython:: python

    es = es.normalize_entity(base_entity_id="sessions",
                             new_entity_id="customers",
                             index="customer_id",
                             make_time_index="join_date",
                             additional_variables=["zip_code", "join_date"])
    es


Using the EntitySet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we are ready to use this EntitySet with any functionality within Featuretools. For example, let's build a feature matrix for each product in our dataset.

.. ipython:: python

    feature_matrix, feature_defs = ft.dfs(entityset=es,
                                          target_entity="products")
    feature_matrix

As we can see, the features from DFS use the relational structure of our entity set. Therefore it is important to think carefully about the entities that we create.
